The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the selector is too specific and causing unexpected behavior.  The `#container` class is nested deep, making it difficult to override styles.

```css
#container > .section > .item {
  background-color: red;
}

#container .item {
  background-color: blue; /* This rule is never applied because of the specificity of the first rule */
}
```
